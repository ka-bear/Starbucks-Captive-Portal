Description: manage access to public internet access
 Nodogsplash controlls access to a public internet connection, as it is
 e.g. commonly demanded for WiFi a HotSpot. It provides a captive portal
 to inform users about the services and optionally have them acknowledge
 the terms and conditions of its use.

 The complexity of user account names, passwords and their maintenance
 is separated into a database-backed authentication server.
